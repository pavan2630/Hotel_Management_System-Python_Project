Hotel Management System

The objective of this project is to simplify the hotel operations by automating the major aspects of hotel management which include checking the availability of rooms, room amenities, check-in, check-out, ordering food, and viewing all the booking record.

Code Architecture:

Database Connectivity (pyodbc Setup): ▪ The pyodbc library is used to connect Python applications to SQL Server using ODBC (Open Database Connectivity).
Creating Tables: ▪ Two tables are created for storing data: i. bookings: Stores booking details such as Booking_Id, Room_Number, Name, Check_In_Date, and Check_Out_Date. ii. ‘food_orders: Stores food order details including Room_No, Booking_Id,  Order_Id, Order_Date, Food_Items, Quantity, Total`. ▪ Two tables are there in the database to retrieve information: i. ‘rooms’: Storing room details such as ‘Room_Number’, ‘Room_Type’, ‘Price_per_night’, ‘Availability_Status’. ii. ‘menu’: Storing food items details such as ‘Dish_Type’, ’Dish’, ‘Price’



▪ Room Management:

Fetches and displays available rooms from the ‘rooms’ table (view_available_rooms() function).
Allows users to view room amenities based on room type (room_info() function).

▪ Booking Management:

Allows users to book a room (book_room() function), generating a unique Booking_Id and store details in the ‘bookings’ table.
Marks room Availability status as Booked in the rooms table upon successful booking.

▪ Food Order Management :

Facilitates food ordering for guests (restaurant() function), retrieving food item details from the ‘menu’ table and storing the order in the ‘food_orders’ table, associating orders with specific bookings (Booking_Id).
Also allows modification of food orders (addition/removal of items).

▪ Check-out Process:

Manages the check-out process (checkout_room() function), calculating total charges including room stay and food orders.
Updates the rooms table to mark room Availability status as Available after check-out.

▪ Viewing All Bookings:

Displays all booking records (view_all_bookings() function) by retrieving data from the ‘bookings’ table, sorted by check-in date, offers a comprehensive view of the current reservations.

▪ User Interface (home() function):

Serves as the home page for users to interact with different functionalities.
Provides error handling and input validation to ensure smooth operation
